"Go ahead, sit on my purse strap and not get up when I say EXCUSE ME, it's not like I exist or take up space. #fuckmenonpublictransit"
@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan @tnr Mohammed loved robbing caravans and looting for a living. ISIS robs and lots for a living.
Kat is completely class less. #mkr
"@98Halima @rfrankh53 @BilalIGhumman @johnnygjokaj @cdnKhadija No, it's not. It's hard to understand how Muslims could believe so many lies."
RT @PatriceChienne: Trill on a plate with smooth stuff. Perfect for budgies with beak problems. #MKR
"""Definitely 8 out of 10. Unless you're Kat and Andre. Then it's a solid and strategic 2 out of 10."""

"Gandhi was pretty sexist, but on #ladyghostbusters: ""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."""
@1Life0Continues part of the reason i'm not actively using it that much is because the weights of each factor are still being decided.
